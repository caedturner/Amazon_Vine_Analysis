### Summary

The Vine reviewers are much fewer in number than everyday uses, also appear to use a much more agressive formula to the reviews they publish. Everyday users seem to have positive bias to products in comparison to Vine users, as you are almost 2 times as like to see a 5 star review from an everyday user v. Vine user. 

Is the higher 5 star review chances from a non-vine user based on positive bias on part of the everyday user, or negative bias on part if the Vine user? The Vine user may feel a sense of responsibility to mitigate their initial opinion and heavily analyze form and function constituting a significantly more cognitive and measured formula to devlope reviews.

to test this theory we could see which reviews are proven to be more helpful by crossreferencing the Vine reviewers v. everyday users and acces the "helpful_vote_ratio" column to see if the vine reviewers fine-toothed comb approach is more helpful to the masses than the impulsive reviews from everyday users.
